## **Predictive Sales Analysis for Pharma Products**

Predicting future demand and optimizing inventory management can be done by using historical data of the products, after cleaning the data its ready for applying a range of predictive machine learning algorithms. The main goal is to forecast future demand and predict sales a key insight for managing products. This enables executive management to make informed decisions regarding marketing, promotions, and overall business strategy. What to sell and when to sell it !


**Predictive analysis using machine learning**  
Predictive analytics involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and predict future outcomes using machine learning algorithms. This document explores multiple machine learning algorithms to achieve the most accurate predictions. 


**1. ARIMA**
-  Stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average.
-  Ideal for time series forecasting with trend and seasonality.
-  Models relationships between past values and future predictions.
-  Best for datasets with consistent, predictable patterns.
- 
**2. Random Forest**
- Ensemble model using multiple decision trees.
- Handles both classification and regression tasks.
- Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple predictions.
- Robust against noisy data and missing values.
  
**3. Neural Networks**
-  Mimics the human brain's structure for deep learning.
-  Effective for complex, non-linear relationships in data.
-  Learns from large datasets to improve prediction accuracy.
-  Flexible, can be used for time series, classification, and more.


These models are chosen based on their ability to handle time series data and other relevant factors. 

**Data Analysis and Visualization with Python**  
Python is used for both the analysis and visualization of the forecasted data. Python has an advantage over other languages with its already present libraries to analyse data quickly and accurately. Following are a few libraries i will be using;


**1. Pandas**
-  Data manipulation and cleaning.
-  Handles large datasets efficiently.
-  Essential for organizing data before analysis.

  
**2. NumPy**
-  Provides support for numerical computations.
-  Efficiently handles large arrays and matrices.
-  Integral for mathematical operations on data.

  
**3. Scikit-Learn**
-  Implements various machine learning models.
-  Tools for model evaluation and selection.
-  Key for predictive analysis.

  
**4. Statsmodels**
-  Specialized in statistical modeling and time series.
-  Ideal for ARIMA and other forecasting models.
-  Supports hypothesis testing.

  
**5. Matplotlib and Seaborn**
-  Creates clear and informative visualizations.
-  Matplotlib is foundational; Seaborn enhances aesthetics.
-  Crucial for presenting data and model results.

- 
**6. TensorFlow/PyTorch**
-  Used for building and training neural networks.
-  Handles complex models and large datasets.
-  Important for deep learning applications.

### **Benefits of Predictive Sales Forecasting**

**Improved Decision-Making**
- Helps executive management refine marketing and promotional strategies by providing data-driven insights. (It helps managers decide the best ways to sell products.)
  
**Supply and Budget Planning**
- Ensures a balanced approach to supply and budgeting, avoiding overstock or stockouts in inventory. (It helps prevent buying too much or too little of a product.)
  
**Strategic Insights**
  Provides a clear understanding of the company's business strategy across different regions, aiding in sales improvement. (It shows how well the company is selling in different places, helping to improve sales.)
